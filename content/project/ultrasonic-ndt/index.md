This project entailed the design of an ultrasonic phased array for operation into the human body using Matlab. The testing
medium consisted of 10 points requiring inspection and a back wall 20 mm away in the z direction.
Huygen’s principle was used to generate a calibration array that enabled appropriate parameters to be selected and
used for the array simulation. The time domain data was converted to the frequency domain using Fourier transform
in order to simplify the analysis. The time domain signals were then simulated and used in three post-processing
algorithms (Total Focusing Method, Focused B-Scan and Linear B-Scan). The resulting data was analysed using
an Array Performance Indicator algorithm that offered a comparison of the different post-processing algorithms.
