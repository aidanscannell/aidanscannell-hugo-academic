This work presents a two-stage method to
perform trajectory optimisation in multimodal dynamical systems with unknown nonlinear stochastic
transition dynamics.
The method finds trajectories that remain in a preferred dynamics mode
where possible and in regions of the transition dynamics model that
have been observed and can be predicted confidently.

The first stage leverages a mixture of Gaussian process experts method
([`mogpe`](https://github.com/aidanscannell/mogpe)) written
in [GPflow](https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow)/[TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)
to learn a predictive dynamics model from historical data.
Importantly, this model learns a gating function that indicates the probability of being in a particular
dynamics mode at a given state location.
In the second stage,
this gating function acts as a coordinate map for a latent Riemannian manifold on which
geodesics are solutions to our trajectory optimisation problem.
Geodesics on this manifold satisfy a continuous-time second-order ODE.
A set of collocation constraints are derived that ensure trajectories are solutions to this ODE,
implicitly solving the trajectory optimisation problem.
The trajectory optimisation is implemented in [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax).
