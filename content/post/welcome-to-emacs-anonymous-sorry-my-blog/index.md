Hello and welcome to my blog.

I am an aspiring researcher (aka phd student) with interests at the intersection of robotics and machine learning.
I am particularly interested in uncertainty quantification in ML and as a result spend a significant amount of time with Bayesian non-parametric methods, specifically Gaussian processes.

I spend some of my time staring at equations and questioning what I am doing with my life.
And I also do a little bit of programming in python within my **beautiful** text editor.

Mainly though, I spend my time configuring my **AMAZING** text editor to make the little time I spend working more enjoyable.
I am all about that work-life balance.

This blog is inevitably going to contain a mixture of Emacs/Spacemacs posts and some more involved mathematical ML posts.
There will probably be some where I just dump the contents of my mind and others where I actually plan what I am going to write.

_Disclaimer 1: I am an Emacs noob at the start of my journey to enlightenment._

_Disclaimer 2: I'm rocking multiple Spacemacs configs and one vanilla Emacs config, so most of my posts will probably be tailored to Spacemacs._

This blog is written in Emacs Org mode ([thanks to ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/)).
