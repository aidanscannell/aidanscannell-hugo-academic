      I obtained my PhD from the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/) under the supervision of Professor Arthur Richards and Dr Carl Henrik Ek.

      Thesis: [Bayesian Learning for Control in Multimodal Dynamical Systems](https://github.com/aidanscannell/phd-thesis)

      It presents novel methods for controlling robotic systems subject to unknown, multimodal dynamics, where some of
      the underlying dynamics modes are believed to be inoperable.
      For example, controlling quadcopters subject to turbulent dynamics modes in unknown locations.

      PhD Work:
      1. [Identifiable Mixtures of Sparse Variational Gaussian Process Experts](/project/mixtures-of-sparse-variational-gaussian-process-experts)
      2. [Trajectory Optimisation in Learned Multimodal Dynamical Systems via Latent-ODE Collocation](/project/trajectory-optimisation-in-learned-multimodal-dynamical-systems)
      3. Mode Remaining Control as Probabilistic Inference
      4. Mode Remaining Exploration for Model-Based Reinforcement Learning
